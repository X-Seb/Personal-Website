## The Concept

In late 2025, I was forced to take a humanities class focused on team collaboration. For the final project, we were challenged to create something that could teach the rest of the class how to promote **Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)** within teams.

While most groups opted for presentations or videos, I suggested to my team (a group of six) that we build a custom **AI Chatbot** trained on high-quality resources. The chatbot would be a virtual coach for students. They agreed, and I took the lead on the technical implementation.

## Data Collection & Training

Garbage in, garbage out. The first step was curating a high-quality dataset.

1.  **Research:** Each team member sourced articles and research papers on EDI principles. We filtered these down to the top three best resources.
2.  **Web Scraping:** I identified four authoritative websites on teamwork dynamics and added them to the training pool.
3.  **Class Integration:** I summarized our entire semester's worth of class notes into a single text document to ensure the bot used words relevant to our course.
4.  **Condensing:** I manually reviewed and condensed the documents to ensure the AI only referenced the highest quality information. ✨

## Tech Stack & Build

I needed an infrastructure that handled training, hosting, and building efficiently. I settled on **Botpress**; it was a platform I never used before, but it looked robust for this specific use case.

### Infrastructure

- **Engine:** Botpress (for NLP and Knowledge Base management)
- **Frontend:** React
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Styling:** Custom palette matching the university's colors (Orange, Green, Blue, Red).

## Development Challenges

Integrating the **Botpress API** into a custom React frontend wasn't entirely smooth sailing.

The main issue was **Session Management**. The bot would often create a new session on page reload which made it "forget" the previous context or conversation history. It took a few hours of debugging the API integration and tweaking the refresh logic so messages persisted correctly and the UI updated in real-time.

## The Logic

Surprisingly, the AI required very little fine-tuning on the backend once the data was clean. Though I did modify the system prompt to enforce a specific response pattern.

**The Bot's 4-Step Response Algorithm:**

1.  **Identify Concern:** Acknowledges the specific student issue.
2.  **Connect to EDI:** Links the issue to one of the pillars of Equity, Diversity, or Inclusion. Then, explains its impact on team performance.
3.  **Propose Action:** Offers concrete, actionable solutions.
4.  **Follow Up:** Asks a follow-up question to keep the user engaged.

The tone was set to be conversational, empathetic, and professional. Like a **supportive coach**.

## The Result

When we presented the bot to the class, the reception was excellent. The bot was responsive, accurate, and genuinely helpful.

It was a solid learning experience in **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** workflows. Botpress proved to be a powerful tool for quickly spinning up knowledge-base bots. I'd definitely use it again for similar use cases where quick deployment and ease of training are priorities.
