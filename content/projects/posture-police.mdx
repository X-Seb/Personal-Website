## The Problem

Like most developers, I sometimes spend 12+ hours a day at my desk. My posture isn't perfect, and by the end of the day, my back can get a little sore...

I also forget to drink water for hours at a time during deep-focus sessions.

I couldn't really find any real solutions to my problem. Most existing solutions usually just set a timer (annoying) or require you to buy expensive hardware.

I realized I already have a camera pointing at my face all day, so I built **Posture Police**: an AI-powered menu bar app that watches my posture in **real-time** and forces me to stay healthy.

## The Stack

- **Brain:** `Ultralytics YOLOv8` (Pose Estimation + Object Detection).
- **GUI:** `rumps` (A simple python wrapper for macOS menu bar apps).
- **Database:** `SQLite` (To log every second of my posture history).
- **Analytics:** `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (For the dark-mode dashboard).

## How it Works

The app runs quietly in the macOS menu bar (`🤖🟢`). Every second (or more often, if I'm checking the HUD), it grabs a frame from the webcam and runs two inference models:

1.  **Pose Estimation:** Detects my nose and shoulders. If my nose drops too close to my shoulders relative to my "calibrated" good posture -> the score drops.
2.  **Object Detection:** Specifically trained to look for my water bottle, so the system knows the last time I drank water.
3.  **Instant Feedback:** The app icon changes color based on my posture. eg: Good posture: 🤖🟢 and bad posture: 🤖🔴
4.  **Data Collection:** Every second of data is stored in a secure local database.
5.  **Data Visualization:** When viewing the dashboard, statistics about posture quality are visible.
6.  **Intant Reminders:** As soon as posture quality is low for too long, the app sends a little notification telling you to straighten up 🤓.

## The Build Process

I've used Python in the past, but this was my first time ever using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** family of models. Luckily, AI is always there to help me. I used **OpenCV** to manage my camera feed, and soon enough, we had YOLO up and running.

### Data Collection

Next, I needed to collect pose data to teach the model what "Good" vs "Bad" posture actually looks like. The YOLO pose model tracks specific points across the body (nose, eyes, shoulders). I logged these normalized coordinates into a massive CSV file.

### Training the Classifier

Now for the "AI Magic." I recorded myself sitting with **good posture** and then with **bad posture** to create a labeled dataset.

I trained a custom classifier (using Scikit-Learn) on top of the YOLO embeddings. This allows the model to output a specific probability score (0-100%) for how "good" my posture is at any given millisecond.

### The MacOS App (Rumps)

With the brain ready, I needed a body. I used the `rumps` library to wrap the python script into a native-feeling macOS Menu Bar app.

It sits quietly in the top bar. When I need to debug (or verify if it sees my water bottle), I can toggle the **HUD (Heads Up Display)**, which draws the `OpenCV` visualizations in real-time.

In this video, you can see the AI calculating my posture score in real time.

### Logic Problem

The hardest part wasn't the AI, it was the UI and the logic flow.

Initially, I had separate logic branches for "Checking Posture" and "Checking Water." This meant if I was drinking water, the app would stop tracking my posture stats, causing gaps in the database.

I had to refactor the main loop to run the logic linearly. Now, the database captures a complete timeline of my day, even when I'm drinking water.

My beautiful water bottle:

## The Dashboard

I didn't want a generic UI. I wanted a cool "Command Center" feel.

I built a custom dashboard using `Matplotlib` with a strict Dark Mode theme. It queries the local SQLite database to visualize:

- **Weekly Focus:** A breakdown of how many hours I spent in "Good" vs. "Bad" posture.
- **Hydration Tracker:** Large text showing minutes since the last sip.
- **Daily Score:** An aggregated percentage of my sitting quality.

## Future Plans

The current version works, but there's always room for improvement.

- **Gamification:** Add a "Streak" system to the menu bar icon so I feel bad about breaking it.
- **Better Data Analytics**: The dashboard can definitely be improved, to show posture improvement over weeks or months at a time. Right now, it can get a little cluttered.

Remember to sit straight and drink water!
