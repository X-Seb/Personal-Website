# Mission Report

This is my **first MDX project**.
I can write normal text, and it looks **cool**.
_More text here_

### Mini List:

- apple
- nvidia
- google

## The Tech

I used **React** and **Tailwind** to build this.

  ### This text is animated! Because we passed the component into the MDengine,we can use it here.

Here is a code snippet:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("This syntax highlighting is automatic")
```

> I can also write Quotes
