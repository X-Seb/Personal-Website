This page is a collection of a few art projects I worked on as a kid. From primary school to high school art, these are the early experiments that started it all.

## Cardboard Engineering

I didn't know what a 3D printer was back then, so I used the next best thing: **Cardboard.** 😎

### The Scrabble Laptop

I made a replica laptop using the leftover cardboard from a Scrabble game box. It has a hand-drawn screen complete with monsters and an airplane.

### The Millennium Falcon

This is a replica of the Millennium Falcon made entirely out of paper plates and cardstock. I tried to make th replica as accurate as possible.

## The Styrofoam Maze

This was one of my favorites to actually play with. It's a dual-level tilt maze made of styrofoam.

The goal is to move a marble from one corner to the opposite side without it falling into the holes. It was lowkey hard; I think I only succeeded a couple of times. It even has a second floor in the middle.

## School Science & Art

### The Spectroscopes

These are light-splitting devices (spectroscopes). I don't know why, but my school made us do this project twice in two different years lol.

/>

They actually work. You put your eye to one end and point the slit at a light source, and the internal diffraction grating splits the light into a rainbow spectrum. 🌈 🤯

### Paper Mimes & Locker Art

I also did paper crafts and drawing. Here are some paper mimes I made and a name tag I designed for my 4th-grade locker.

## The Electronic Cat House

A few years later (in high school), I built this: An electronic house in the shape of a cat.

It wasn't just a model; it had functional circuits. You could push the eyelids in, which triggered an alarm system. There is also a door on the left side (hard to see in the photo) and I kinda forgot what it's supposed to do...
