After a successful first year, **we're back.**

This time, I was elected to be the team captain and I had a ton of new ideas I wanted to implement.

This is the full log of my second and last year as a participant at CRC (Canadian Robotics Competition).

It's been a challenging year but I learned more than I ever could have imagined. These lessons will be with me for the rest of my life.

## Getting ready

Before the first semester started, we were already at work. We reorganized the sub-team structure to counter the shortcomings from the year before.

Next, we cleaned up the robotics room by getting rid of a few items that we didn't need. I also prepared a sponsorship package for potential sponsors.

Our theme for the year was **Plants vs. Zombies** which we need to incorporate in our video, kiosk, website, etc.

**Let's go!**

## Orientation Day

On orientation day, we did a quick presentation about the team and already recruited some new members. Nice.

We also put up some posters around the school to incite people around the school to join us.

## The Robot:

STEP 1: Dissassembling last year's robot:

Now that the old robot has been dissassembled, it's time to build the new one.

In TakTik 2025, the game involves manipulating donut-shaped pieces (Game Pieces, or GPs). We need to place them on various "posts" and also launch them on a small center post.

Our robot is a Mecanum-based machine that has two main systems:

- A claw system made for picking up game pieces (GPs) & stacking them on the posts
- A flywheel system used to store & shoot GPs onto the center post.

## Drivetrain

Our first step was building a drivetrain. We opted for a drivetrain made of **T-slotters**, equipped with 4 **Mecanum wheels**. Each motor was attached with **custom 3D-printed motor mounts**, which were re-modeled multiple times.

Each motor is quite powerful:

And here's the final drivetrain:

## Claw System

Of course, we needed a way to grab the GPs. It took many iterations, but we eventually devised a complex claw system, equipped with **2 servos**.

This allows the claw to both rotate on itself and open/close.

Using this design, the claw can grab up to **3 GPs at a time.** The claw was re-printed 6 times (ouch), but the final version was reliable.

## Conveyor Belt

Next, we needed a system that could feed GPs to a launching mechanism (which was built later). We opted for a conveyor belt system that will feed the GPs into a small storage area.

## Flywheel

We need a launching system to throw the GPs onto the center post.

At first, we considered using two flywheels to launch the GPs, but we realized that this would be too bulky and wouldn't "spin" the GPs in the air.

We decided to go with a different and more reliable design: **one flywheel with a curved ramp.**

Finally, it was time for the real battle – **cable management.** It looked like a spaghetti mess, but after a few days of work (and lots of 3D-printed wire holders), we managed to bring the robot to life. Each motor, servo, and sensor was ready for action!

## Winter Break

The winter break gave us two full weeks of uninterrupted work. We spent countless hours perfecting the drivetrain, the claw system, and the shooting system.

By the end we were getting a lot more reliable.

After many months of brainstorming, prototyping, testing, and (probably too many) snacks, our robot was ready.

And it's pretty fast. 😅
