I joined the Vanya Robotics team on my first day of school and it's been a crazy ride! This is a full log of the first year of my participation on the team and how we participated at the CRC robotics competition. Before this I didn't have much experience with robotics. I played with some Lego Mindstorms in high school but that's about it. I had to code in C# and other than that I was a complete noob!
