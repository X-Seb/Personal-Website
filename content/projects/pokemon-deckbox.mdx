## The Problem

In March 2025, fresh off the **CRC Robotics Competition**, I found myself diving back into the Pokémon TCG. The issue? I only had two deckboxes, and they were falling apart.

Commercial deckboxes are often flimsy plastic or overpriced leather. I needed something **sturdy, unique, and engineered** to actually protect the cards.

## The Design Process

### 1. Constraints & Measurements

The process started in **Fusion 360**. I used **digital calipers** to measure the exact dimensions of a standard sleeved deck (63mm x 88mm). I established a tolerance of +0.5mm to ensure a snug fit without damaging the card edges.

### 2. Iteration V1 (The Failure)

My first print was a functional failure.

- **Issue A:** The box was too wide, causing cards to rattle.
- **Issue B:** The wall thickness was excessive, wasting filament and print time.

### 3. Iteration V2 (The Mechanism)

For the second iteration, I added two key features:

1.  **The Visibility Window:** A cutout on the front face allowing the player to see the "Commander" or top card without opening the box.
2.  **Rotary Locking Ring:** Instead of a friction fit (which wears out), I designed a turning ring system. The ring rotates to lock the lid in place, mimicking the aesthetic of a Pokéball.

## The Result

I printed the final assembly on a **Prusa** using multi-colored PLA (Red top, Black ring, White base). The locking mechanism snapped perfectly into place, and the tolerances were dialed in.

It’s not just a box; it’s a functional prop that protects the deck while looking sick on the table.
