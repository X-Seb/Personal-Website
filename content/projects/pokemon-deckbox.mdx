## The Problem

In March 2025, fresh off the **CRC Robotics Competition**, and with lots of free time, I found myself playing some Pokémon TCG with my friends.

The issue? I only had two deckboxes, and they were falling apart. Commercial deckboxes are usually kida flimsy or made of overpriced leather and bulky. I needed something **sturdy, unique, and engineered** to protect my cards.

## The Design Process

### 1. Constraints & Measurements

The process started in **Fusion 360**. I used a standard ruler to measure the exact dimensions of a standard sleeved deck (63mm x 88mm). I the box a tolerance of +0.5mm to keep the cards safe without damaging them.
I also added a cutout on the front face that allows the player to see the top card without opening the box.

### 2. Iteration V1

My first print didn't quite work as expected...

- **Issue 1:** The box was too wide, causing cards to rattle.
- **Issue 2:** The wall thickness was too large, wasting filament and print time.

/>

### 3. Iteration V2

For the second iteration, I reduced wall thickness, and made the box slightly more narrow.

I also added a **Rotary Locking Ring**. Instead of a friction fit (which wears out), I designed a turning ring system. The ring rotates to lock the lid in place, kind of like a real Pokéball. 😏

## Final Result

I printed the final assembly on a **Prusa** using multi-colored PLA (Red top, Black ring, White base). The locking mechanism snapped perfectly into place, and the tolerances were dialed in.

It’s not just a box... it’s a functional build that protects the deck while looking sick on the table. 🔥
