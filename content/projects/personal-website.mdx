**You are currently inside this project. :)**

This website is the third iteration of my personal portfolio.

Back in the day, I built one using Google Sites, but didn't like the customization; it was too restrictive. Later on, I tried again with vanilla HTML and CSS, but that was a nightmare.

I wanted to give it another go and build an awesome website where I can showcase all my projects and share what's on my mind.

Let's do this!

## 🛠️ The Full Arsenal

This website isn't just a static HTML page. It's a dynamic application built on the modern React stack.

It combines a retro aesthetic with modern web design.

Here's the final stack:

- **Framework:** `Next.js 15` (App Router + Turbopack)
- **Language:** `TypeScript`
- **Styling:** `Tailwind CSS` + `Framer Motion` for the animations.
- **Content Pipeline:** `MDX` (Markdown + JSX) for projects and articles.
- **Optimization:** Manual image compression with `Squoosh` + Next.js `Image`
- **Code Highlighting:** `rehype-pretty-code`
- **Icons:** `Lucide React` & `React Icons`.

## 🎞️ The Evolution

I recorded the development process but it an ongoing project, whenever I still upload new projects, write blog posts, and keep the design up-to-date.

Here is the full development process:

### Hero Section

I always think it's cool when there's a full-screen video on the home page, so I wanted to build that on my site too.

Here's what it looks like at the start:

<Image
  src="/images/projects/personal-website/hero-section-first.webp"
  alt="The early version of the hero section"
  caption="The background is grey because I did not add a video yet."
/>

I also made a simple navbar. I already had a clear idea of the general sections I wanted on my site like projects, skills, blog posts, videos, games, etc.

### Project Grid

I wanted a 'Bento' style grid that could handle different aspect ratios (2x2, 2x1, 1x1).

It's more interesting than a basic carousel or a standard grid. It also allows me to make my best projects larger than my 'mid' projects.

Here's what it looked like at first:

<Image
  src="/images/projects/personal-website/project-bento-grid-first.webp"
  alt="Early implementation of the Bento Grid"
  caption="The Grid Logic V1"
/>

### Content Pipeline

As I was adding projects to the grid, I realized that doing this manually was going to be **super annoying.** 💀 I needed a content management system that lets me easily create/modify the different projects.

So, built a custom pipeline that reads local `.mdx` files and then turns that to at TSX file.

This allows me to write projects in markdown format and still have cool features on the frontend like images, video, code, headings, or bold words on the page.

  caption="Each project's content lives in a single MDX file."
/>

And this is what it looks like on the frontend: <Link href="/projects/edi-ai-chatbot">EDI AI Chatbot</Link>

### Video Games & Videos

I've spent a lot of time building video games and documenting the process through YouTube videos. In fact, I made six video games in total and roughly 10 videos documenting the process.

I wanted to add these on my website, so I made simple carousels for the videogames and videos. To get the videos, I had to use the YouTube API but it wasn't too hard.

  alt="My Video Games"
  caption="My Awesome Video Games"
/>

### Skill Tree

We should also have a section dedicated to skills.

I think of life as a video game. The goal: always to accumulate more skills to raise my value and be more useful to society.

Building this section was also a good way for me to reflect on myself and my competencies as a human. I need to level up. Fast.

The "Skills" section went through multiple versions.

In V1, I tried to split my skills into three categories but some of the didn't really "fit".

<Image
  src="/images/projects/personal-website/skill-tree-section-v1.webp"
  alt="Version 1 of the Skill Tree"
  caption="V1: A bit chaotic..."
/>

So I ended up going with six different categories, each with a drop-down menu containing the individual skills.

  alt="Version 2 of the Skill Tree"
  caption="V2: Clean & categorized."
/>

### Game Mechanics - Inventory

As you explore the site, you can acquire items to fill up your inventory. I can't think of any other website that lets you do that. I think it's a fun, unique feature.

This also gives me the possibility to hide a bunch of easter eggs across the site. I'll make some kind of hidden reward if you can find all the items... though I won't say what it is here. 🤡

This is the first version, it's a section on the home page:

<Image
  src="/images/projects/personal-website/inventory-light-mode.webp"
  alt="Inventory in Light Mode"
  caption="Light Mode (Flashbang Edition)"
/>

As I added more items, I realized that the inventory section might become very long and too big to put on the home page. So, I moved it to a separate page, added dark mode, and built a system that hides items until you obtain them.

<Image
  src="/images/projects/personal-website/inventory-dark-mode.webp"
  alt="Inventory in Dark Mode"
  caption="Dark Mode (The correct way)"
/>

To manage the inventory and chests across different pages, I needed a global brain. I stuck to React's built-in **Context API** to build it.

The system relies on a `GameState` object that tracks everything:

1.  **Inventory:** An array of collected items.
2.  **Flags:** Booleans for specific events
3.  **Chests:** An array of opened chests

### Work History & Education

I also wanted a section to track my story. So in the character lore section, you can see my education and work history. It's simple and effective. As you scroll down, you can see my story from newest to oldest.

  alt="Character Lore Section"
  caption="Lookin' slick"
/>

### The Video

Since I wanted a video on the home page, I had to edit one. I tried to show a wide variety of different projects that I've made throughout the years.

As I work on new projects, I might need to update the video, but for now it's not bad. I use Davinci Resolve to edit all my videos because Davinci Resolve is the best. 💪

### Launching The Site

It wasn't all smooth sailing. I had to manually optimize every image using Squoosh.

  alt="Optimizing images in Squoosh"
  caption="Squooshing assets to save KB."

And the Vercel builds failed a few times...

/>

## 🚀 The End Result

A fully responsive, type-safe, and interactive portfolio that represents who I am.

### Future Updates

This is just the beginning.

- I'll keep adding new projects as I build new things.
- I'll also write more blog posts over time.
- I'll update my work history in character lore.
- I'll make sure my short bio is up-to-date, depending on what I'm doing at the moment.
- I will add new skills as I acquire new ones.

I have a nice skeleton for my site; let's fill it up with awesome adventures!
