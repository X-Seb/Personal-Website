As a kid, I was obsessed with building things. This project was my first real taste of competitive engineering.

The challenge was hosted by my elementary school. The rules were simple:

1.  Build a bridge using only standard popsicle sticks and white glue.
2.  Meet specific minimum dimension requirements
3.  Do not exceed the maximum weight
4.  **The Test:** Apply pressure using a hydraulic press until catastrophic failure.

The score wasn't just about strength, it was about **efficiency**. The formula was **Max Load Supported / Bridge Weight**. A heavy bridge that held a lot wasn't enough, you need to be light _and_ strong.

## The Build

I teamed up with my friend Tyler. We had roughly two months to design and construct the bridge.

I wish I had photos of the process, but I remember it well. We spent hours many clamping sticks together, waiting for glue to dry, and obsessing over the bridge geometry. It was tedious work, but the deadline kept us focused.

## The Crush Test

On competition day, we faced the hydraulic press.

I think we placed **4th or 5th overall**. Honestly? We kind of got screwed over on the testing rig setup (but I won't get into the details lol).

Our bridge eventually failed due to a shear crack on the left support structure. You can see the exact moment of failure in the aftermath photo below.

## Reflection

Looking back, this simple wooden bridge was the biggest engineering task I ever faced at that age. It was the first time I applied physics to the real world in the context of a competition.

The bridge is long gone, but the obsession with building stuck.
