I read **$100M Money Models** by Alex Hormozi and took some book notes.

The book:

<Item id="money-models-book" />

I thought it was kind of pointless for me to keep my notes only for myself, so I decided to share them online.

Here they are:

## 3 Main Factors to Make $$$

### 1. CAC (Cost to Acquire a Customer)

The average cost to acquire a customer. Includes ad spend, labour, software, etc.

- Use **lead magnets** and **attraction offers** to lower CAC.
- **FREE** drives down CAC by a lot, but lowers lead quality.
- **Discounts** (always 50%+) drive down CAC and smooth upsells. Generally don’t discount the core offer.
- CAC can only go down so much; eventually, it will be similar to competitors.

### 2. GP (Gross Profit)

The amount of $$ you get from a customer, after deliverables cost.

- **Gross Margin** = (Price Client Paid / Gross Profit) \* 100%
- Increase GP with more offers, downsells, continuity offers.

### 3. Payback Period

Time until **GP ≥ CAC**.

- To reduce payback period: **Make more offers.**

**(5) Times to upsell (in chronological order):**

1.  Immediately
2.  Next step
3.  Big win
4.  Halfway point
5.  Last chance
    _(Notice how most upsell opportunities are early on.)_

### Client Financed Acquisition (3 levels)

1.  **LTGP > CAC** (Bare survival)
2.  **30 Day GP > CAC** (Can pay back credit card in 30 days)
3.  **30 Day GP > 2 \* CAC** (Unlimited scale - 2x is the minimum)

**You should keep working at the money model until you can get to level 3.**

## The Money Model

A series of offers designed to get more customers, pay more, in less time.

**Ex: Rental Car** - The game is all optimized to make more money.

- **Upsell:** Bigger car (because reserved one isn’t available)
- **Upsell:** Waive late fees (escape a made up fee lol)
- **Upsell:** Premium insurance upgrade?
- **Downsell:** ok… So just the minimum then? (called minimum, like you need to have it)
- Prepay for gas?
- Late return
- Reward Program

> **Note:** Money Models aren’t patentable, there’s no IP. You just need to make crazy $ before everyone else catches up, then change it up again. Innovators can make like 80% of the money before the marketplace catches up.

## 4 Types of Offers

First, we talk about attraction offers, which are designed to get customers in the door.

### 1. Attraction Offers (6 Types)

#### Win your money back

Set a goal for customer + give instructions. If they do it → get money back (aka **rollover upsell**).

- Good for businesses that require clients effort.
- Great cash flow + onboarding + they get better results.
- Works with new, current, and previous customers.
- Actions/goals customers need to do need to be easy to track.
- **Sales:** Ask them if they want short or long term goals? This will kickstart long term.
- **Skin in the game:** Rollover upsell.
- **Everyone is a winner:** Do rollover upsell at midway point and end of the program.

#### Giveaways

Give away 1 or 2 copies of my premium offer for free. Then, sell everyone else a discounted version of that same offer, or a downsell.

- Of course, always have scarcity and urgency.
- The grand prize needs to be **epic**.
- Ask for contact info, ask qualifying questions, require specific actions (attend call/event, make a post, enter a group) = free ads + more loyal customer.
- **Key thing:** Contact everyone else privately with the promotional offer.
- Always have a downsell available as well.

#### Decoy Offer (FREE)

Advertise a free/smaller offer, but sell them a much better premium offer instead. Offer both options, but emphasize on the premium one (assumed close).

- Make the contrast **HUGE**.
- Present premium offer first. If they really want the decoy: _"Are you here for free stuff or do you want lasting results?"_, then: _"Which do you think will get you to your goal faster?"_. Then assumed close. Get excited about the premium offer.
- If they choose the free offer, add a few bonuses from the premium offer too.

#### Buy X get Y FREE

Instead of using a discount, increase price of each item, but give away stuff for free along with the purchase.

- **Ex:** “Buy 1 shirt (20$), get 2 FREE” instead of “Buy 3 shirts at 33% off (6.67$ > 10$)”.
- **Ex:** “Get 6 months, get 12 months FREE”.
- You can mix and match the free stuff. Always try to give out more free things than paid things.
- Works really well for business that generally only sell once.

#### Pay Less Now or Pay More Later

Gives the customer the option to pay later at full-price - **ONLY** if they like it, or pay now, at a discounted price with bonuses.

- Get their card on file, only bill them if they think they got results after getting the thing.
- **(1)** If they take the pay later option, **THEN:** **(2)** offer to pay now + give them bonuses.
- The “pay now” part is there to pay for CAC.
- There should be a clear YES/NO result. There need to be clear conditions for getting $$ back.
- **Recurring Business ex:** Pay higher rate 30 days later OR pay lower rate today but keep it forever + add in bonuses.
- Pay special attention to people who didn’t get the results, help them to avoid refunds.

#### Free with Consumption

Basically, you get people to consume 20min to 5 days worth of content → facilitates big sales.

- **Ex: Events:** Day1 - Give, Day2 - Give/Pitch, Day3 - Repitch/Give.
- **Ex: 3-5 Day Challenges:** VERY VERSATILE: can be in-person, online, 1 to Many, 1on1, etc.
- **Do CLOSER framework:** Our Story, Ask about goals/obstacles, Relate to customer, How we can help, What we’ll cover, Ask if they might be interested in working long term.
- **BREAK BELIEFS (3):** Blame circumstances, blame others, fear.
- **TEACH CONCEPTS NOT TACTICS.**
- **5 Steps:** Current beliefs, Why it’s wrong, New belief, Why it’s right, Proof.
- **Ex: Webinars:** Same steps as the 3-5 day thing, but condensed into 90min. (Benchmark: Try to close 10% of people who are there live.)

### 2. Upsell Offers

Basically anything you sell next to your customer.

#### Classic Upsell

You simply do an A/B sale on the next thing they would need.

- Just offer the next thing they would want! They’re gonna buy it anyway!
- _“You don’t want anything else do you?”_ (Implied sale) ← **VERY POWERFUL**

#### Menu Upsell

It’s a 4 step process where you prescribe things for the customer to buy. Implied close.

1.  **Unsell:** Delete items from the list that they won’t need (builds trust).
2.  **Prescribe** items they do need (make it feel personalized).
3.  Ask which they prefer (A/B sale), implied close ← **VERY POWERFUL**.
4.  _“Do you just want to use the card on file”_? ← **VERY POWERFUL**.

- **Bonus:** Employees love this. Even better, you can actually have the employee pretend to be against the system by recommending competitor products or giving items for free. (help a homie).
- **Extra (The Economist Play):** If you have 2 options and you want customers to pick the most expensive one, put a middle option to nudge them towards the bigger option. **Ex:** place a middle option that’s very close (or equal) in price to the expensive offer, but much worse in comparison.

#### Anchor Upsell

You show a very expensive item first (5-10x more), then: present a much cheaper similar option that has a few less extra features.

1.  Treat the anchor upsell as a serious offer, watch the customer gasp.
2.  Come to their rescue: offer a similar thing that’s only slightly worse, and a lot cheaper.

#### Rollover Upsell

Apply customer credit as a discount for another thing over a long period of time.

- Can be used in so many different situations:
  - Use as part of a "Win Your Money Back" initial offer.
  - Re-engage old patients with a “winback” campaign.
  - Save my own upset customers.
  - Steal other people’s upset customers 😏.
  - Or just to upsell regular customers.
- Always add urgency to rollover upsells (One-Time Only).
- Also, rollover upsell should only discount up to 25% at most of the new offer.
- **Bonus: Gift Card Play:** Advertise a 90% off gift card. Limit to 2 per customer. So the existing customer pays for the card, I ask who it’s for + intro. When referral comes in → rollover upsell.

### 3. Downsell Offers

If people aren’t taking my offers → use downsells to save people who otherwise wouldn’t have bought anything.

#### Payment Plans

Just spread out the payments. You can use as a way to test out your current pricing in the marketplace, since you always show the more expensive option first, then show payment plan option to lower the price after.

**7 specific steps to payment plan downsells:**

1.  Reward for payment in full (give a discount), _“Would you like to save some money?”_
2.  Offer 3rd party financing, credit card, layaway options.
    - _Credit card ex:_ “Would you rather I decide your payment plan or you decide?” → “Ok, use a credit card. That way, you can pay the credit card company over time as you choose; longer than you have with my payment plan.”
3.  **Layaway:** Make customers pay completely before they get the product.
4.  Half now, half later? _“What’s the most you can pay today?”_
5.  _“On a scale from 1 to 10, how bad do you want to do this?”_ YES → Keep going. NO → feature downsell.
6.  Offer 3 payments.
7.  Offer to evenly spread payments.
8.  Offer a trial with penalty.

**During the payment plan:**

- Offer them to pay the whole thing upfront to get the original discount amount instead of the payment plan extra.
- Charge them on paycheck days!
- **Alternative technique - Seesaw Downsell:** _“Would you rather have giant monthly payments or tiny ones?”_ → Tell them the more they pay upfront, the smaller monthly payments they’ll have. This frames the payment plan as a negative.

#### Free Trial With Penalty - “Call a Free Trial”

Let a customer try product/service for free, as long as they meet my terms. If they don’t meet the terms, you charge them a penalty fee. Gives them added incentive to follow through (very similar to Win Your Money Back).

- **ALWAYS** get their ID and card before starting the trial.
- **Script:** _“I’ll trade you for whatever card you wanna use.”_ → Get card to complete their profile. Just say _“But that’s how we’ve always done it + Shrug”_.
- Ask _“If this program got you results, would you stay long term?”_
- Then explain the fees. _“This is the best way I can get you results and keep it free for you. Best of both worlds.”_ Force them to do: meetings, testimonial, advertise, referral.
- **Angry customer (after trial):** Be more mad than them, then sell a “better fit” thing (rollover upsell).

#### Feature Downsells

Basically, you remove features from your offer and lower the price.

- **What you can downsell:** Quantity, Quality, Speed, Entire Features, DFY - DWY - DIY, Guarrantees, Personalization, Provider Qualification, Content Format.
- Make sure to remove the highest-value thing first, so they see their value, and then upsell themselves. **Ex:** The Guarrantee.
- If no go → Make a huge decrease in price + remove mid features = more value.
- Do temperature check after 2 downsells (like payment plans).
- Generally, name the cheapest combination “The Minimum” -> _“Ok, so nothing more than the minimum package then?”_
- **Extra:** If existing customers aren’t using all the features, you can feature downsell them by removing what they don’t use. Builds insane loyalty + they’ll never churn out.
- Barter with reviews, testimonials, referrals, free promotion (it’s a different offer).

---

### 4. Continuity Offers

Lets you significantly increase customer LTV and get more through the door since the payment is smaller. Recurring revenue is great to raise entreprise value, also great to keep your company stable. However, continuity takes a while to get $$ from customers.

- Add **lifetime discount** at your month of greatest churn to decrease churn.
- **CANCELLATIONS:** (make policy ahead of time)
  - Make clear steps to cancel = low risk AND they’ll leave less bad external reviews.
  - If customer is mad, be **MORE MAD** than them.
  - Generally have cancellation fee equal to the bonus value they got.
  - **ALWAYS** get an exit interview (upsell here) - Lets them avoid cancellation fee.

#### Continuity → FREE Bonus Offer

So you have an expensive bonus package that you offer for FREE when customer joins the continuity program (+ also gets other benefits).

- Anchor the bonus first, then _“Do you wanna know how you can get this for free?”_
- Find the right balance in price to nudge people into continuity, but also getting enough cash up front.

#### Continuity Discount Offers

Make a one-time discount or FREE continuity offer for long-term commitment.

- Works really well with industries that can enforce contracts (cell phones, real estate, hosting services).
- Generally does **NOT** get customers profitably.
- You can add the free months at the front, at the back, or spread out.
- You can get them to pay a little upfront (ex: pay for the last month, setup fee, etc.).
- Could give the discount in the form of a gift card.

#### Waived Fee Continuity

Have a large fee upfront that they can avoid if they prepay for continuity. If they want to cancel, they have to pay the onboarding fee.

- Call it something like: initiation, onboarding, setup, activation… whatever.
- Very sticky, people don’t churn out thanks to the big fee.
- Drop the fee after the commitment.
- Works really well for services that take a long time to work.

## Other Tips

- When running events/workshops/presentations, hint at next offer early. Imply that “everyone” always wants it.
- Pay experienced people lots of $$ to learn their skills 1 on 1.
- **ALWAYS do BAMFAM.** (Book a meeting from a meeting)
- If you sell out of anything, take payment anyway. Then, set expectations of delivery.
- **A/B Sale** and **implied sale** might just be the most powerful sale technique ever, use as much as possible. You can nudge the customer in the direction you want = seemless buy.
- The **Gift Card Play** is actually insane. Literally get paid to get warm referrals.
- If customer is mad, be **MORE MAD** than them. (applies in all aspects of life btw).
- When doing sales, always be **The Helpful Guide**. Never negotiate on price.
- **BILL WEEKLY** - You’ll make 8.3% more money annually.
- Add 3% processing fee. Ask if they want to avoid it → Get a second form of payment (ACH).

### Target Numbers to hit:

- **30 Day Cash** ≥ 2(CAC + COGS)
- **LTGP:CAC** ≥ 3:1
- **Gross Margin** ≥ 80% (in service-based businesses)
