It’s kind of embarrassing to admit... but at 19, this was my first time ever leaving the North American continent. I went to South Africa for a wedding, and the experience was overall fun and I learned a few things...

## The Trip: A Concise Breakdown

The journey started with a marathon travel day: Montreal to Atlanta, then a massive haul to Cape Town. I was surprised by how "Western" everything felt—English. Familiar brands, malls, and technology that looked exactly like home.

We started with a safari in Kruger. The schedule was crazy (4:00 AM wake-ups), but seeing cheetahs, lions, and elephants up close was worth it.

I'm always surprised by how malleable humans really are. If I can wake up at 4 AM for animals, I can do it for work.

The second part of the trip was in Cape Town. We hiked Table Mountain (legendary view), saw penguins, and saw the downtown areas. The trip end with a mountain wedding. And yeah, it was quite emotional ngl...

The only downside? **Lack of control.** I was basically stuck to my family's pace (souvenir shopping), which felt like a waste of time. I realized freedom isn't just about money; it's really about controlling the most important thing you have – time.

## 🔬 Observations

- **Global Homogeneity:** Cities are surprisingly similar. Infrastructure and culture (music, brands) are standardized globally. It’s comforting, but makes the world feel a bit smaller...
- **The Winner Effect:** Winners always hang out with winners. High-value people hang out with each other. Every. Single. Time.
- **The "Plane Work" Skill:** It's so hard to do deep work in economy class. This is a skill I need to master (or just buy business class lol).
- **English is King:** It unlocks the entire world.

## 🧠 Self-Audit: What I Learned

- **I Need Control:** I hate following someone else’s slow pace. Being a "passenger" in my own vacation really frustrated me.
- **Emotional Regulation:** I spent too much time being annoyed at my siblings. It was a waste of energy and ruined my own mood.
- **The "First Move" Block:** I realized I am still hesitant to approach "high-status" people. I can hold a conversation perfectly once it starts, but I sometimes avoid the initiation. There was literally nothing to lose (especially on a vacation with people that I'll probably never see again), yet I hesitated.
- **Risk is Fun:** The best moments were the unscripted ones. Safety is boring.
- **Inefficiency is Pain:** Waiting for food at restaurants is a waste of life. Delivery or fast service always.

## 📝 Protocol for Next Time

1.  **Master the Approach:** Stop overthinking. Talk to the "winners" immediately. They are just people.
2.  **Fix the "Aura":**
    - Speak louder and articulate clearly.
    - Use a firm, short handshake.
    - Have a prepared "Mini-Intro" of who I am.
    - Steer conversations toward my interests.
3.  **Always Close:** Don't just chat; get the contact info.
4.  **Buy Freedom:** Next time, I will have the funds and independence to control my own itinerary. No more waiting around.
