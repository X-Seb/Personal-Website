## The First Post...

This is the first post on my new website...

I've been wanting to have a personal website for a couple years now. I made one in Google Sites during high school but I never updated it. 😅

Later on, I experimented with different ways to build a website but none of them gave me the complete customization I wanted. There was always a something missing...

So, I just built my own. I'm glad I did because I learned a lot during the process, even if it took longer than using a no-code platform.

I wanted to add a blog section to my website just to share notes, thoughts, and anything else.

## Blog System

I also built a little system that lets me write articles in markdown format and then it gets turned into a page on the website.

### I can also add headings!!

And I can add images, videos, links, or `items` :) I can't think of a single website that lets you acquire items as you explore different pages. I thought that was a unique concept and it could be fun.

And here's a free item for you:

## My Story So Far...

Anyway here's a quick recap of my story so far:

In high school, I mainly developed video games and it was lots of fun! I made a few games and even documented the process on my game dev channel.

But I realized that creating video games didn’t have the positive impact that I wanted to have on the world. I remember watching my little brother play Fortnite for hours without even moving from his chair and I just knew that something was really wrong... The worst part is I remember myself being that gamer kid during my earlier years...

So that’s why I got into robotics! I’m not really sure why I was so drawn to robots, even at an early age I was building stuff with LEGOs and especially liked robots.

Honestly, I barely knew anything about robotics, but I joined the Vanier Robotics Team, worked hard, and eventually felt decently competent. However, I realized that as much as I love building robots, I should probably find a way to make money pretty soon (because I’m so broke 😭). I’ve wanted to make a real business for many months now too…

Since I was already building custom automations for myself, I decided to do so commercially for other businesses. That’s how Silent Stacks was born. Now, I help B2B tech companies by developing custom AI automations, which can perform various tasks.

I truly think that entrepreneurs are amazing and are the force that actually change the world.
