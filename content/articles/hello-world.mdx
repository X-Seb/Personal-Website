## Building a Personal Website

I've been wanting to have a personal website for a couple years now. I made one in Google Sites during high school but I never updated it. 😅

Later on, I experimented with different ways to build a website but none of them gave me the complete customization I wanted. There was always a something missing...

So, I just built my own using `Next.js`. I'm glad I did because I learned a lot during the process, even if it took longer than using a simple no-code platform.

## Future Website Updates

The whole point of a personal website is that it reflects who you are.

Since I'm always changing, the site needs to evolve with me.

- **Skills:** As I unlock new abilities, I'll update the Skill Tree.
- **Projects:** Every new build goes into the Project Grid.
- **Lore:** If my career or status changes, the "Character Lore" gets patched.
- **Writing:** I'll be adding dev logs and essays consistently.

Luckily, changing the website is actually not too hard. I'd say the most annoying part is optimizing the images; everything else like adding a new project, adding a new skill, adding a project, or even creating a blog post is all pretty straightforward.

## My Story So Far...

Anyway here's a quick recap of my story so far:

In high school, I mainly developed video games and it was lots of fun! I made a few games and documented the process on my game dev channel.

It was an amazing learning experience, I learned so much about coding, video editing, 3D modeling, image editing, Unity, etc.

But after two years, I realized that creating video games didn’t have the positive impact that I wanted on the world. I remember watching my little brother play Fortnite for hours without moving, and I just knew something was wrong... The worst part is I saw my younger self in him.

So that’s why I got into robotics!

I’m not really sure why I was drawn to it, but I joined the Vanier Robotics Team, worked hard, and eventually felt competent. However, as much as I love engineering, I realized I needed to figure out the "money" game pretty fast (because I’m broke 😭).

Since I was already building custom automations for myself, I decided to do so commercially for other businesses. That’s how Silent Stacks was born. I helped B2B tech companies by developing custom AI automations and workflows.

I did this for a while, but I had a hard time getting new customers. However, the customers I worked with were always very nice and often came back asking for more automations or products.

I learned a lot about n8n, sales, business management, etc.

## Current Goals

I've thought a lot about what I wanted to do with my life and I'm very aware of my own mortality. It's something I think about a little too much maybe. 😅 But that urgency drives me.

There are currently 3 main "big" quests I am pursuing:

1. **Upgrade My Character**
2. **Create Value for Others**
3. **Live cool experiences**

First, I need to relentlessly upgrade my character as fast as possible. This means:

- Building up my mind (Courage, Focus, Discipline, Bias to Action)
- Building an optimal body
- Developing as many skills as possible
- Accumulating resources (wealth/influence) to make big moves

By leveling up, I'll have more control over my life (agency). This ties in perfectly to #2: **Creating Value**.

If I don't upgrade myself, it's difficult to have a meaningful positive impact on others.

Finally, I want to live a life worth documenting. If I became the ultimate version of myself but never lived awesome experiences, I would have failed. I want to explore the world, try new things, and spend time with the people who matter.

If every decision, habit, and action in my life gets me closer to #1, #2, or #3, then I think I can say I lived a "good" life (hopefully with no regrets).

## So... What's Next?

Ok cool, but what's the next step? The next step is boosting my skills.

I'd like to create value for others by developing innovative technologies (related to robotics, AI, or energy). I especially like robotics at the moment, yet I'm not very skilled in that domain. I need to level up my robotics skills as fast as possible and build my crew of smart ambitious people.

To increase my skills there are a few things I could do like:

- I could get a job in a high growth tech company.
- I should also build many personal projects to develop my skills even further

Eventually, I'll find a particular problem that energizes me and I'll go all-in. But at the moment, my skills are so low that I can barely see opportunity at all.

As I acquire more skills, the fog will lift and I'll be able to see the landscape for what it is.

If I fail my first startup, I'll simply try again and again and again. I can try as many times as I need until I die. I will never give up.

I'm documenting the journey because I always wish the "greats" had documented their early days. I'll share my thoughts in these blog posts and on social media.

I also started a podcast where I share what's going on. I even bought a new mic so the audio doesn't suck. Here it is:

I will succeed. I don't care if it's hard.

The hard things are the only ones worth doing.
