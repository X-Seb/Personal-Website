No cold emails. No ads. Not even a website. This is exactly how I got my first clients.

I didn't even have an actual product yet. I just knew what I wanted to do: **Custom AI Automations.**

So, I managed to get a free ticket to **Startup Fest**, a massive three-day event here in Montreal. At first, it was a bit overwhelming, it was my first time going to a real "conference" event and there were people everywhere.

I know there are a tons of strategies to get clients, but I thought it was better not to overcomplicate things.

My strategy was simple: **Just go ahead and talk to people.**

## The "Non-Pitch" Strategy

I showed up on day one and just started chatting with the other volunteers. Immediately, I saw there was demand. Everyone wants to "add AI" to their business, but nobody knows how.

I never actually pitched them.

Building automation is super specific to the business. If I walked up and listed features, they would have zoned out. Instead, I just **asked questions**. I tried to understand their pain points.

Oftentimes, they didn't even know what they needed. They would ask _me_ for input on what was possible. By the time I answered, I wasn't a salesman anymore; I was basically a free consultant.

## The Follow-Up Protocol

When someone seemed interested, I didn't hand them a card. I said something like, "Hey, let's connect after StartupFest," and got their LinkedIn and phone number.

**The most important step:**
On the _same night_, I texted every single person I met.

- It keeps you fresh in their mind.
- It breaks the ice for the next time you need to contact them.
- It makes you seem like a nice, friendly person.

I've been doing this habit of texting people the same night, and it's worked wonders. You're so much better off texting them the same day than the day after.

Throughout the three days, I talked to roughly 20 interested leads.

## Closing the Deal (From the Library)

A few days later, I scheduled Google Meets to get a comprehensive view of what they needed.

Fun fact: My room was being renovated at the time, so I had to take these high-stakes sales calls from the **public library**. The Wi-Fi was trash. But hey, we made it work. Luckily it wasn't too noisy.

**The Result:** Two confirmed sales. Two clients willing to pay for a service that didn't exist a week prior.

## What I Did Wrong (Rookie Mistakes)

It wasn't all perfect. Looking back, I made two big errors:

1.  **No Upfront Payment:** I didn't ask for a 50% deposit. I just took their "Yes." Technically, they could have bailed at any moment. I took on all the risk.
2.  **No Contracts:** I didn't have an NDA or service agreement ready. Having an official document increases the perceived value of your service. It makes you look like a pro, not just a guy in a library lol.

## The Lessons

**1. In-Person > Online**
I could have sent 1,000 cold emails and maybe I would get some sales, but so far I've had much better luck in person.

When you show up in person, you can build trust and credibility.

Overall I got pretty good ROI for this event.

**2. Enthusiasm > Experience**
Enthusiasm makes up for a lot. You might be inexperienced, but if you show you are hardworking and excited, people will give you a shot.

**3. Speed is everything**
You don't need a website. You don't need a perfect offer. You just need to get your idea in front of other humans as fast as possible.

If you have an idea, just go to an event and talk to people. It actually works.

I will definitely go to events to get leads in the future... I think it would be even more effective if I give a talk or workshop at one of these events. Though, for that I need to build up proof & experience.
