When I was 16, my father (a university professor) went on sabbatical, and the whole family moved to North Carolina for a year.

If you had told my younger self that I was moving to a different country for a year, I would have been terrified.

But honestly? I was super excited. I was tired of being the lazy kid reading webcomics in the back of the class. I needed a fresh start.

I entered my **"Overly Engineered Productivity"** phase. Think Ali Abdaal, complex Notion systems, habit trackers, gratitude journals, all that stuff. Looking back, a lot of it was unnecessary overhead, but it set the stage for what was coming.

## The Routine

The first few days of school were rough. I knew nobody. I was staring down a mountain of AP classes and felt a little sad. I was worried I wouldn't have time for my personal projects. And I barely had a bed. 😭

But after the first week, I swapped a theoretical class for a math class, and I settled into a rhythm.

I didn't have a social life. I didn't hang out with people after school. And that turned out to be my biggest advantage.

Every day I only did three things: School, family time, **Grind.**

## The Builder Arc

I started learning how to type properly. Then programming. Then web development.

Then I tackled the big one: **Game Development.**

I bought a Mac (my first one ever) after my old laptop died, and I went to work. To this day, my Mac is still my main weapon of choice.

- I learned Blender.
- I coded my first game (a simple ball-rolling game).
- I edited and published my first YouTube video.

I was terrified to hit publish. I didn't even share it with anyone. For the first few videos, I got **zero views**. But I kept going.

By video #4, the algorithm picked me up.

By video #8, I hit **100 subscribers**.

I spent the year balancing AP exams (got 5s on all of them, of course), family trips to Disney and Universal, and the personal grind.

## The Lessons

### 1. Solitude is a Feature, Not a Bug

I didn't make any "real" friends in North Carolina. We talked in class, but we didn't hang out. In fact, I barely text the people I used to know in NC.
At the time, it felt a little lonely. In hindsight, **it was necessary.**
If you want to learn, grind, and go all-in on a new skill, not having a social life for a season is a superpower. It gives you the silence you need to focus.

### 2. Pain Tolerance & Delaying Gratification

This was the first time in my life I ever focused on a single project for months without getting paid a dollar.
I made 10 YouTube videos and coded games for 4 months straight before seeing any real traction. That year taught me that I can outlast the boredom.

### 3. The World is Small

I was surprised by how similar the US was to Canada.
The students played the same games (Clash Royale, Valorant, etc). The culture was 90% the same. It made me realize that "Western Civilization" is pretty standardized. You can go anywhere and find your footing.

### 4. You vs. You

By the end of the trip, I felt a new sense of agency. I realized that if I put my mind to something, I could actually get results.
I also realized that **most people are lazy.**
It is not that hard to beat the competition, because most people aren't even trying. You are really just competing against yourself.

## Conclusion

On the last day of the trip, I ennoyed time with family and read _Unordinary_, the same webcomic I used to read during my lazy period.
But it felt different. I wasn't reading it to escape anymore. I was reading it as a reward for the most productive year of my life.

I came to North Carolina with big dreams and aspirations and I did my best to learn as much as possible.

I'm proud of my growth during this season of my life, it definitely got me closer to my goals.
