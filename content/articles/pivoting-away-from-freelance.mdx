Over the last few weeks, I’ve been navigating my first semester of electrical engineering in university + the demands of a growing automation business.

The experience has been a helped me with time management. And it forced me to confront a brutal truth about my business model…

## The Start of School… (again)

The first week of school was surprisingly calm. With a light homework load, I was taking client meetings between classes and spending my evenings building automations. I was "doing the work."

During this time, I was reading business books like **$100M Money Models** by Alex Hormozi.

I realized that right now I didn’t really have a business. It was a high-overhead, low-paying job that I had created for myself. 😔

### The "Customization Trap"

The proof was in a single project: a "vibe check" system for a really nice client I met at StartupFest.

- **Initial Scope:** A simple ~15-30 hour project.
- **Reality:** A **120-hour marathon** of custom development and revisions.

When I finally did the math, dividing the project fee by the hours invested… I was making a much less than minimum wage. 💀

I was caught deep in the **Customization Trap**. I was selling my time for a fixed, low price, and it was completely unsustainable.

Before starting the contract, I was so inexperienced so I thought I was charging appropriately. Now, I realize how much effort goes into even the "simplest" project...

## The Pivot to Predictability

The pain of that realization forced me to pivot. My #1 priority became building a predictable, scalable client acquisition machine.

Relying on events is great, but it isn’t a system. (I will definitely keep going to events, it's just that I want to diversify my lead flow.)

So, I invested in cold email infrastructure with **Instantly.ai** and started learning the ropes. My first few campaigns were "mid," but they produced results: a 3% reply rate and a booked meeting.

### Lesson: Businesses Buy Results, Not Bots

That little meeting was another critical lesson. I went in planning to sell my "AI Responder Agent," but the prospect was only interested in one thing: **Lead Generation.**

It’s an obvious truth in hindsight: businesses don’t buy automations; they buy results. Specifically, they buy **more revenue**.

- Internal Efficiency Tools = Low Value
- Sales/Revenue Tools = **High Value** (3.5x more lucrative)

This sharpened my focus completely. From now on I'm focusing on building bots that directly lead to more sales.

## The "Grant Bot" Experiment

This new focus led me to my next project: the **Grant Bot**.
It’s a system for a robotics startup. The bot scrapes the internet for government grants in Canada → then recommends the best fits.

The client's reaction to the V1 demo was immediate, even though I was just showing him a spreadsheet of scraped data. 😅

**Why?** Because the Grant Bot isn't a "nice-to-have" vitamin; it's a **painkiller**.

Finding grants is a manual, soul-crushing nightmare for founders. But, these grants can be worth hundreds of thousands in funding. A system that solves this problem is not just selling an automation: **it's literally selling free money.**

The build process has been challenging (reverse-engineering Salesforce APIs, web scraping, database), but the end product will be valuable and **Productizable**. ✨

## The Path Forward: From Freelancer to Business

I’ve had to make modifications for past clients, juggle classes (+ learn which ones to skip), and push through the difficult middle stages of a new product build.

My business model has to evolve. I am moving away from highly personalized, one-off projects. The goal is to take on jobs that involve building **high-value systems that can be productized.**

**The New Strategy:**

1.  **Get Paid to Build It Once:** Find a client with a painful problem.
2.  **Productize It:** Build a robust solution.
3.  **Distribute It:** Sell that same solution to 100 other people with that problem.

**What's Next?**

1.  **Build the Engine.** More cold email campaigns focused exclusively on Lead Gen.
2.  **Targeted Strikes.** Using platforms like Upwork to find high-value sales-focused projects.

It’s been a painful but rewarding month. The goal is no longer just to be a builder. The goal is to build a business.

Thanks for following the journey. I’ll catch you in the next one. 🫡
