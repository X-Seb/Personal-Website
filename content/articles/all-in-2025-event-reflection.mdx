This is the story of how I tried to save $1,400 and ended up paying a much higher price in dignity and time. 😔 But the failure was worth the lesson.

So in September, there was a massive tech event in Montreal called "ALL IN". A ton of big shots from the Canadian tech scene were going to be there, I even recognized some of the names.

However, the tickets cost **$1,400**. Obviously, I didn't want to pay that because that was a significant part of my money. So, I thought I’d be smart.

I sent a couple of cold emails to the ScaleAI team (event sponsors). They referred me to one of the ladies running the event, so I emailed her. Eventually we hopped on a call and I joined the "work team."

The plan was simple: get paid to be there, sneak in some networking, and enjoy the event for free. **I was wrong.**

## First 2 days

The first two days were actually not too bad. We had the paid employee training on day one. It went well.

On day two, I woke up at 5AM to get to the event by 6. It was the first official day of the event. The beginning went smoothly, but I didn't have as much time as I wanted to do networking.

I was stuck at the front desk giving people their tickets while all the action was happening on the inside. It felt horrible. Like everyone was winning except me. 😔

## The Incident

On day 3, I messed up big time.

The uniform requirement was simple: **Black Pants.**

I woke up, got dressed, and headed downtown. I arrived at the venue, ready to network.

Immediately, I got pulled aside.

> _"You're wearing green pants."_

I looked down. They were dark... but they were definitely green. Since I woke up so early, I couldn't tell my pants were green in the darkness. I put on the wrong pants.

I tried to explain. I tried to reason. It didn't matter. I was "cooked." They kicked me out and told me I couldn't work until I had the right uniform.

## The Scramble

It was 8:30 AM. The event was starting. And I was running around downtown Montreal like a headless chicken trying to find a SINGLE PAIR of black pants.

I called my friend who lived downtown so I could maybe borrow his pants; he wasn't home.

I checked google maps for any store that sold black pants.

**The problem?** Nothing opens until 10:00 AM on a weekday.

I ran from street to street, seeing only closed stores... Even Google maps couldn't save me.

So there I was, wandering aimlessly outside the venue, knowing that inside, thousands of people were connecting, making deals, and building the future. And I was outside, with green pants.

To make matters worse, I found out that another guy on the team got assigned to be the personal assistant to the **Canadian Minister of AI**.

He was literally shadowing one of the important person there.

I was better than him. I knew more about the tech than him. I was more talkative than him. But because I was outside dealing with this nonsense, he got the opportunity of a lifetime, and I got... well, some money for my hours.

## The Realization

Walking those streets, angry and embarrassed, I realized I really messed up.

**I wasn't a participant. I was staff.**

When you try to "hack" the system by working for it, you lose your leverage.

- If I had bought a ticket, I would have been an **attendee** (a peer).
- Because I was working, I was basically a **servant** (staff).

They didn't want me talking to people. They didn't want me networking. They wanted me to stand still and shut up.

I originally thought that I'd get some time to network because that's how it was at previous event I went to. My assumption was wrong. I should have asked that question during the interview.

All my troubles could have been saved with one question

## The Lesson: Opportunity Cost

I tried to save $1,400.
But if I had just paid the money, I could have:

1.  Avoided the stress entirely.
2.  Walked in the front door with my ticket like everyone else.
3.  Networked freely with high-net-worth individuals.

If I made just **one** good connection or closed **one** client, I would have made that $1,400 back ten times over.

Instead, I saved the money, but I lost the **opportunity**.

**Conclusion:**

Next time, I’m not working the door. I’m buying the ticket. If you want a seat at the table, sometimes you just have to pay for it.
