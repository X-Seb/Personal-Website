After completing the first version of this website in early 2026, I was looking for my next project.

I decided now was a good time to **level up my engineering skills** and dive into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

I knew how to code, but I felt like I was really lacking fundamental DSA knowledge...

Let's do this.

## The Beginning: LeetCode

I made a **LeetCode** account and started coding.

It was actually quite intimidating at first. 😅 There are thousands of problems, and even though I had experience with game dev, Arduino, and web dev, my raw problem-solving abilities weren't sharp enough yet.

I simply did not know the basic patterns & tricks. At the start, I could rarely solve a "Medium" problem without assistance. 💀

But with AI as my guide, I started tackling them one by one.

## The Concepts

I went from topic to topic, which helped me see how these concepts connect together. I explored many concepts in over a short period of time:

- **Arrays & Strings:** Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Prefix Sums, Kadane's Algorithm, Greedy Algorithms
- **Search & Sort:** Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.
- **Graph Theory:** Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Data Structures:** Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, Heaps.
- **Low Level:** Bit Manipulation (Logic gates, toggling bits).

Before this, if you told me something had to run in **O(n)** time, I would have looked at you blankly. Now, I know that Space & Time Complexity (Big O) is actually straightforward... implementing the algorithm is the hard part!

## Encountering New Structures

I did a modified version of the **Blind 75** to start.

- **Binary Trees:** I had seen pictures of them, but never wrote code for one. It was actually so cool to see how **Recursion** is used to parse these complex structures (e.g., Inverting a Binary Tree).
- **Linked Lists:** Reversing a linked list felt like voodoo magic the first time I did it, but now it seems so simple. Same thing for using fast & slow pointers.
- **Bit Manipulation:** This was surprisingly chill. Since I've done circuit work before, I understood the logic gates (AND, OR, XOR). Though I did learn a few tricks like checking if a number is a power of two or getting the lowest set bit.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Some of my favorite problems involved dynamic programming, like: Climbing Stairs, House Robber, Unique Paths, and Dungeon Game.

## The Virtual Contest 🏆

As I got more confident, I attempted my first **Virtual Contest**. I had no idea what to expect.

- **The Challenge:** 4 Questions (3 Mediums, 1 Hard).
- **The Result:** I solved the first two Mediums!
- **The Wall:** I ran out of time on the third question, even though I correctly identified it as a BFS problem.

It was a humbling reality check, but also proof of progress. I still have much to learn...

## My Favorite Problems So Far

Some problems are just satisfying to solve. Here are my top picks:

1.  **Build a Full Adder:** Super cool low-level logic.
2.  **Dungeon Game:** The first "Hard" problem I ever completed.
3.  **Number of Islands:** One of the first times I successfully applied DFS on a grid.
4.  **Invert Binary Tree:** My "aha!" moment with recursion.

## What's Next?

I eventually discovered **AlgoMaster**, a curated collection of LeetCode questions presented in a specific order so you learn incrementally.

I switched to this track because it provides a more structure than jumping around problems randomly.

My plan is simple:

- Continue grinding through the AlgoMaster curriculum.
- Use AI to explain the deeper concepts _after_ I solve (or fail) a problem.
- Do **weekly contests** to benchmark my speed and accuracy.

I'm taking it one problem at a time. **Let's do it.**
